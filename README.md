### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Career switcher from musician and teacher to software developer. Since completing the Northcoders bootcamp I have continued to build skills in front and back end development and am ready to lay my focus on a career in either direction. 

- I'm currently working on devekoping a music journal and practice log app utilising the cross platform capabilities of React Native. The front and back end repos are available on my profile.

- Take a look!
